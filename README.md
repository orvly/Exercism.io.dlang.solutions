# Exercism Solutions For The D Language
Solutions for [Exercism.io exercises for the D Language (dlang) track](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/d).

Exercism.io does let you download all your solutions, but it's the code only, and in some cases I used some extra D libraries after writing the original solultion in pure D libraries, just to get a better feeling for the language, and in these cases I also wanted by dub.sdl file to also be saved.

I kept the readme.md file which describes the problem unchanged, since almost all solutions are heavily commented in the code itself. 

In some cases I also added to the readme.md some thoughts/considerations regarding my solution as well.
